# How to set up MDo on Android

There is no official Android app yet.

However, this is how I sync my MDo files to Android:

1. Find a text editor with markdown and Dropbox support. (I use [iA Writer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.ia.iawriter&hl=en))
2. Move all MDo files to Dropbox.
3. Profit.

This setup allows me to:

- see my to-dos on the go
- edit to-dos or mark them as complete
- create new to-dos

However, I have to wait until I'm back on my computer to actually _process_ the file (remove done to-dos, automatically move stuff between sections, etc).

It's not too bad, but I'm hoping to build an MDo Android app in the near future to make it better.
