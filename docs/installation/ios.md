# How to set up MDo on iOS

There is no official iOS app yet.

However, this is how I sync my MDo files to iOS:

1. Find a text editor with markdown and Dropbox support. (I use [1Writer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1writer-markdown-text-editor/id680469088))
2. Move all MDo files to Dropbox.
3. Profit.

This setup allows me to:

- see my to-dos on the go
- edit to-dos or mark them as complete
- create new to-dos

However, I have to wait until I'm back on my computer to actually _process_ the file (remove done to-dos, automatically move stuff between sections, etc).

It's not too bad, but I'm hoping to build an MDo iOS app in the future to make it better.
