# FAQ

## How is MDo pronounced?

ehm-doo

## Who built MDo?

My name is Alexis Hevia. I'm a remote web developer at [X-Team](https://x-team.com/) currently working from Panama City, Panama.  
[github](https://github.com/alexishevia), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexishevia/)

## Why did you create MDo?

I tried a couple of different to-do apps (everyone out there seems to be making one of those), but I couldn't find one that had the features I wanted AND was simple/fast to use.

I figured I spend most of my time inside a text editor anyway, so it makes sense having my text editor be my to-do app. And so MDo was born.

Shout-out: [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) came very close to what I was looking for, but the "one line per to-do" rule was a deal-breaker for me. If you're looking for a text based to-do app with a LOT of support, and don't mind that one-line restriction, take a look at todo.txt. PS: I have big plans for MDo though, hopefully you'll stick around :)

## Are you getting paid to build MDo?

No. I'm building it to "scratch my own itch".

## Will MDo always be free?

I'm not sure about the "always" part (the future has too many unknown unknowns).

To be honest, I'm not even sure anyone other than me will even find MDo useful. Hopefully you will :)

However, I can say I currently don't have any intentions to make money from MDo. And if this ever changed, I'd probably still keep it as an open-source project.

## Are you looking for help?
