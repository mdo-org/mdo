# Contribute to MDo

This is the first open source project I'm maintaining, so I'll probably suck at the whole "foster your community" thing.

However, I'm happy to receive bug reports, feature requests, questions, and pull requests. Here is [MDo's github](https://github.com/mdo-org/mdo). Feel free to create new issues or PRs.

I can't promise I'll be super responsive - all I can promise is I'll do my best without sacrificing my current job or work/life balance.

## What are you looking help with?

Initially, I'd like to get more people using MDo and opening bug reports or feature requests.

Currently, the [installation section](/installation/) is a bit lacking.

If you like messing around with text editor configs, I could really use your help to figure out how to get MDo working on as many text editors as reasonable.

If you know/want to learn how to develop plugins for text editors, I could really use your help to make MDo easier to install.

If you know/want to learn about Android/iOS development, I could use your help to build mobile apps for MDo.
