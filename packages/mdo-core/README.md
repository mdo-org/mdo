# mdo-core

mdo-core is meant to be used by MDo plugins and MDo flows.

If you are trying to use MDo to manage your to-dos, you probably want to look at
[mdo-cli](../mdo-cli/README.md).

## Overview

mdo-core contains logic for parsing and processing MDo files. It also exposes some helper methods for dealing (and testing) streams of MDo blocks.
