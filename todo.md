# To-Do

- [ ] improve landing page
  - add a 'How to use' or 'How to install' section with instructions for different editors
  - add in-depth documentation (most of it is already written in the docs folder, just need to clean up and expose it)
- [ ] make eslint happy
      there are a couple places where I'm disabling eslint rules with /_ eslint ... _/
      we should reconsider rewriting to make eslint happy
