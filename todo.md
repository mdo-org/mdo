# To-Do

- [ ] convert all mdo-core files from typescript to javascript
- [ ] split plugins / flows into separate modules using lerna
  - add eslint as build process
  - move "test" scripts out of individual packages
  - add at least one test to the mdo-cli package
- [ ] figure out how to get `.test` files out of npm packages
- [ ] improve 'docs' directory
      maybe use https://www.gitbook.com/ ?
- [ ] create an interactive page / tutorial where you can try out MDo in the browser
- [ ] make eslint happy
      there are a couple places where I'm disabling eslint rules with /_ eslint ... _/
      we should reconsider rewriting to make eslint happy
