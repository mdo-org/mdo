# To-Do

- [ ] figure out how to get `.test` files out of npm packages
- [ ] improve 'docs' directory
      maybe use https://www.gitbook.com/ ?
- [ ] create an interactive page / tutorial where you can try out MDo in the browser
- [ ] make eslint happy
      there are a couple places where I'm disabling eslint rules with /_ eslint ... _/
      we should reconsider rewriting to make eslint happy
